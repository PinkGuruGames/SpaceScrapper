  title: Endra Corp.
  description: 'Endra Corp. is the name of one of the most influential tech-corporations
    in history. They initially started off as a research team for Artificial Intelligence,
    and quickly got traction when they aided in the development of the first near-sentient
    AI, around 8 million years ago. They later moved on to developing highly efficient
    and fully autonomous drones for military use.

    Predating even the <b>Ordalian
    Empire</b> it later integrated itself in, the company has now long been shut
    down due to multiple major violations of various peace-keeping and anti-exploitation
    treaties with <b>KAL-19</b> and its moons.
