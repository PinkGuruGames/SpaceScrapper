  title: Humanity
  description: 'Humanity has come a long way since the first men landed on the moon.
    Over the course of millions of years, humans have established their presence
    in multiple solar systems and even different galaxies. Technology has become
    advanced enough to prolong human life, and humans have become so genetically
    diverse that some populations are classified as aliens in some nations. In lieu
    of that, humans that attempt to keep the genes of ancient 3000s era humanity
    intact, built a large following of pseudo-aristocratic purists. '
