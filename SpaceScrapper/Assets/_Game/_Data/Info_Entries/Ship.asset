  title: My Spaceship
  description: An old <b>Adris V7</b>. The model was manufactured by <b>Limrey Machinery
    Ltd. </b>, released to the public 5 million years ago and has not undergone many
    changes in later versions. It is a private travel-class ship, meaning that it
    has great defensive capabilities to keep the passengers in good shape, but is
    legally required to be pacifist. Therefore, any kind of weaponry is unavailable
    for purchase.
