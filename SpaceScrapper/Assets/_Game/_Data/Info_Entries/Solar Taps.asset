  title: Solar Taps
  description: "Solar Taps are enormous constructions designed to harvest large amounts
    of energy from stars. They are conceptually similar to <b>Dyson Spheres</b> but
    differ in that they don\u2019t fully enclose a given star, and instead freely
    hover around it. These power plants rely on <b>artificial gravity</b> technology
    to reliably harvest energy and generate fuel for commercial use. The net power
    output of solar taps is roughly around 3.0 - 12.4 * 10^19W with the only limiting
    factor being longevity. \r\nA multitude of stars in the old galaxies have been
    functionally drained through this process of extracting energy from them.\r\n"
