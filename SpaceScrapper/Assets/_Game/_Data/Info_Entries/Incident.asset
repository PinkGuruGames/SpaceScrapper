  title: Howshier Incident
  description: 'The Howshier Incident marks the events of the first ever artificial
    collapse of a red dwarf. Most information about the incident is still classified,
    even millions of years later. The only public sources reported of a malfunction
    in one of the sections of the energy extraction units that provided the Howshier
    system with energy. As a result of the collapse, multiple planets and local space
    stations have been wiped out. The damages were estimated to be around 241.7 trillion
    dollars and the number of dead at 87 billion. '
