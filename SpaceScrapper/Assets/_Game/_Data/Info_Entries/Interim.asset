  title: Interim Galaxy
  description: "The Interim Galaxy was the result of two older galaxies merging and
    forming new constellations. It wasn\u2019t until the year 8\u2019076\u2019410
    that humanity has been able to set foot in it. According to current estimates,
    roughly a quarter of the Interim Galaxy is inhabited by humans in one form or
    another. Due to its relatively recent colonisation, the political forces don\u2019t
    have a lot of influence in many places throughout."
