  title: The Great War
  description: The Great Intergalactic War is what the latest war between the <b>Ordalian
    Empire</b> and the <b>Union</b> was named, based on its unprecedented magnitude.
    An unimaginable number of lives were lost to the horrifying nature of <b>artificial
    supernovas</b>. Both sides lost the majority of their critical political infrastructure
    to the war. The order of events and the full extent of the losses are yet to
    be documented in detail.
