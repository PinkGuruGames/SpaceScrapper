  title: The Ordalian Empire
  description: The Ordalian Empire is the dominant military and political force of
    the <b>old galaxies</b>. Most of the wealth they acquire through predominantly
    trading of resources is invested into scientific research and technological advancement,
    to make as much as possible out of what they have. Through that funding, the
    <b>Forbnis Research Team</b> was able to increase the accuracy of wormhole technology
    enough to allow for cheap and fast galactic travel among other achievements.
