  title: The Union
  description: "The United Systems of the 8th Wing, commonly referred to simply as
    \u201CThe Union\u201D, is a political union of 280 of the first 548 colonised
    solar systems in the <b>Interim Galaxy</b>. With its massive amounts of controlled
    planets with valuable resources they are generally perceived as very wealthy,
    which is also represented by the golden crest on their common banner. \r\nMembers
    of the Union generally value the conflicting concepts of wealth and artistic
    expression above all and are hesitant to resort to military violence in any given
    situation.\r\n\n"
