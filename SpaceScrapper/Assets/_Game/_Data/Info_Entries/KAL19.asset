  title: KAL-19
  description: "KAL-19 was once a working colony planet, chosen because of the natural
    occurrence of many valuable minerals. It has been liberated by a revolution of
    the working class, and officially established as an equal business partner of
    the <b>Ordalian Empire</b> 2.5 million years after its founding. \r\nThe treaties
    between KAL-19 and the <b>Ordalian Empire</b> were meant to ensure healthy trading
    conditions for both parties.\r\n"
